# social-media-chatbot

This project was created for a coding session with the goal to introduce Dutch high-school girls to programming and inspire them to embrace IT!
The text in the notebook is in Dutch.

Follow the instructions in the Python notebook to program a chatbot that performs several actions that are typically seen in social media.

Happy learning!
