Step-by-step procedure to run the code:
1. Download Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 from https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools
2. Install the Build Tools previously downloaded. This installation requires Admin Rights. The installation takes some time. 
2a. If asked, tick as desired workload the box of "Build Tools for Visual Studio 2017" for C++, with the default settings. 
2b. After successful installation, restart the laptop.
3. Make sure to have Python version 3.6.x, because from 3.7 pyaudio wheels are not supported
4. Download & Install Anaconda (I used Anaconda3-5.2.0-Windows-x86_64 (x64))
5. Open Anaconda Prompt
6. Check current packages and their versions: python -m pip list 
7. Upgrade pip to latest version: python -m pip install --upgrade pip
8. Upgrade setuptools to latest version: python -m pip install --upgrade setuptools
9. Navigate to the folder of the chatbot repo
10. Create a virtual environment with all the required packages\dependencies: conda  env create -f environment.yml . 
10a. If it gives you network error, it may be the case that your network is blocking conda. Try to use a different network, for example your mobile phone as hotspot. If issue persists, check your firewall settings.
11. Activate the environment. On Windows, run: conda activate chatbot_social_media_2
12. Start up Jupyter: jupyter notebook
13. Have fun with the notebook!


Note: 
If the Google's Text-to-Speech service from Google raises error in the Notebook, it may be due to the fact that the Google's packages are not up-to-date anymore.
In that case, you need to upgrade them: pip install --upgrade gtts  and pip install --upgrade gtts-token
Also, do not forget to update the new version number of these packages in the environment.yml file, to keep it up-to-date.
